## Neural Style Transfer (optimization method) :computer: + :art: = :heart:
This repo contains a concise PyTorch implementation of the original NST paper (:link: [Gatys et al.](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)).

This repo is a copy of Gordić Aleksa with some further improvements like visualization of feature maps and gram matrix for the optimizing image and using a layer 1 content feature map because that worked better for me and also i changed the weights of tv, content and style which I found better also this repo now supports using 2 style images instead of 1.
